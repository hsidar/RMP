A Ruby on Rails webapp for people to document raccoons and the items they have accquired.

Part of a project I did for my code bootcamp. I took a liking to it and decided to flesh it out a bit more for learning.

Using this app to explore Bootstrap and the Devise authentication Gem in Rails as well as the database behind the [Popcorn Engine](http://popcorn-engine.herokuapp.com)

###Components

User login where once verified, they can create up to 3 raccoons, name them, and give them things.

Images stored in AWS S3 instance.

Nav bar with drop down for account management and link to create new raccoon.

###Features

API link to get a list of all raccoons and their avatar images.

###Design Aesthetics

Sepia toned background.

Bootstrappy
